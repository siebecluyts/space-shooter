        <p>Space shooters is a game where you are a rocket who has to defend the earth and itself by destroying the meteorites by shooting them.</p>
        <h3>Power Ups!</h3>
        <p>The newest update just released, and now we have Power-Ups! You can get a power-up when you have less than 4 lives to collect, shoot, or catch them.</p>
        <p>Watch out for the Down Ups! These only spawn at 4 or 5 lives. When you catch them, you will lose a life. You can shoot them and they won't deal damage.</p>
        <h3>The next update!</h3>
        <p>In the next update we will be adding explorer mode! Explore the universe and defend different planets for coins! The harder the planet, the more coins! With coins, you can buy upgrades and more!</p>
